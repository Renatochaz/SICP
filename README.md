**Course Objectives and Expected Outcomes (from MITC OCW Website) **
*Learning Objectives
Upon completion of 6.001, students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods from programming languages to analyze computational systems, and to generate computational solutions to abstract problems. In particular, students will:

Be able to explain and apply the major mechanisms for control of complexity in large programming systems:
Building Abstractions
Controlling Interaction through Conventional Interfaces, and
Designing New Languages
Be able to discuss issues of programming style and programming aesthetics.
 
Be able to read and modify a substantial (20 pages) Scheme program, if it is written in exemplary style.
 
Be able to design and implement programs in Scheme that demonstrate the concepts covered in the course, specifically:
Recursive and Iterative Processes and Procedures
Higher Order Procedures
Object Oriented Methods
Data Abstractions
Procedures with State
Dispatch on Type
 
Be able to understand and modify an interpreter for a Scheme-like language, either at the level of a register machine description or at the level of a higher order language description.
Measurable Outcomes and Assessment Methods
Students completing 6.001 will have demonstrated an ability to:

Design, implement and test short (1/2 page) recursive programs in Scheme that demonstrate the following concepts (measured by problem sets and quizzes):
Building Abstractions:
Computational Processes
Higher-order Procedures
Compound Data
Data Abstractions
 
Controlling Interactions:
Generic Operations
Self-describing Data
Message Passing
Streams and Infinite Data Structures
Object-oriented Programming
 
Meta-linguistic Abstraction:
Interpretation of Programming Languages
Embedded Languages
 
Analyze the operation of a Scheme-like interpreter using the substitution and environment models (measured by problem sets and quizzes).
 
Design, implement and test at least one substantial (5 pages) program (measured by project).*
